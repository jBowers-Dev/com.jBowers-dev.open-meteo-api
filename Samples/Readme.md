# Samples
*Only use this folder for examples, do not add any assets that are vital to the package. You will need to work on these outside of the package folder, i.e move the demo folder under Assets while you work, then back to the package folder once you're ready to update.*

----

Samples are a great way to give the user example scenes/scripts to play around with and learn, although they are optional. Once your sample is ready, be sure to add it to the Package.json file in your package
